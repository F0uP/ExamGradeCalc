# ExamGradeCalc

![](resources/logo.png)

This program is designed to calculate grades accordinf to the german university style (1.0,1.3,1.7,...) based on user input and data provided as a .csv file.

## Getting Started

There is a `requirements.txt` file inside the repository. Using `pip install -r requirements.txt` you can install them easily. More is not needed. You can also create a python environment with conda o.e. but it is not necessary.

## How To Use?

You can start the application by typing `python3 main.py` inside the console.
The next step is to provide the path to the csv file to the system as well as some other required data such as point boundaries. You can also let point boundaries get generated by the system itself, but you can also manually do that to have more control. If you chose to let the system calculate the boundary, you have to set the passing percentage at which a student has passed the exam.

After setting everything up, you can choose a location in which the file should be saved. You can also choose the file format, the system should compile the markdown into. Supported are PDF (experimental and watermarked caused by library usages) Markdown and HTML.

After a short loading period the system should have saved your file.

## How To Provide Data?

The data of the csv file should look like this:
```csv
;exercise1;exercise2;exercise3;exercise4
max;5;10;10;10
person1;1;7.5;8;2
person2;5;2.5;10;0
person3;2;6;7;10
person4;5;10;10;10
```

The first line should name the exercises available in the exam. The second row is provided to define the maximum amount of points you can get in this exercise. After the max column there is space for as many people that scored points in the exam as you wish. Every row should contain the amount of points scored in the exercise.
