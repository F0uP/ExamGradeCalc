# ExamGradeCalc

![](resources/logo.png)

This program is designed to calculate german grade in university style (1.0,1.3,1.7,...) based on user input and data provided as a .csv file.

## Getting Started

There is a `requirements.txt` file inside the repository. Using `pip install -r requirements.txt` you can install them easily. More is not needed. You can as well create a python environment with conda o.e. but it is not necessary

## How To Use?

You can start the application by typing `python3 main.py` inside the console.
The next step is to provide the path to the csv file to the system as well as some other required data such as point borders. You can also let point borders get generated by the system itself, but you can also manually do that to have more control. If you chose to let the system calculate the border, you have to set the percentage in which the student has passed the exam.

After setting everything up, you can choose a location in which the file should get saved. You can also choose the file format, the system should compile the markdown into. Supported are PDF (experimental and watermarked caused by library usages) Markdown and HTML.

After a short loading periode the system should have saved your file.

## How To Provide Data?

The data of the csv file should look like this:
```csv
;exercise1;exercise2;exercise3;exercise4
max;5;10;10;10
person1;1;7.5;8;2
person2;5;2.5;10;0
person3;2;6;7;10
person4;5;10;10;10
```

first line should name the exercises available in the exam. second coloumn is provided for the maximum amount of points you can get in this exercise. After the max column there is space for as much people that scored points in the exam as you wish. Every row should contain the amount of points scored in the exercise.
